- **Powerful N-dimensional arrays:** Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and
broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.
- **Numerical computing tools:** NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number
generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more. 
- **Interoperable:** NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well
with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.
- **Performant:** The core of NumPy is well-optimized C code.
- **Easy to use:** NumPyâ€™s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from
any background or experience level.
- **Open source:** Distributed under a liberal BSD license, NumPy is developed and maintained
publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) by a
